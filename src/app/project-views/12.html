  <p>Tasty Trucks is a mobile app where users can search a map for nearby food trucks, view the trucks’ menus, place and pay for an order, and review their experience.</p>
  <p>This was my first time creating a brand identity, and the directive was to create something fun and friendly that would make people want to order lunch.</p>

    <p>I started by creating a Niice mood board to find some color inspiration from food and really latched on to the colors and shapes of bell pepper ribs for a while, but ultimately when I started creating color palettes these felt too old world, and the shape of the bell pepper didn’t really translate when I digitized it, so I went back to square 1.</p>

    <p>I decided to just start sketching some things to see where that took me. Here you can see a few of my earliest ideas alongside my user flow- at this stage the app was called Truck Rally, and I kinda ran with it on a literal wavelength just to get started.</p>
    <p> While I didn’t stick with any of this, the checkered flag made me think of classic diners, which always feel fun and friendly to me, and always make me want to order lunch.</p>

    <h4>An Aha Moment!</h4>
    <p>From here I moved into back into color palette mode, but instead of using veggies and fruits as my inspiration I used photos of the shiniest diners I could find and found a great palette almost immediately.</p>

    <div class="cs-text">Meanwhile, back in my notebook I was sketching low-fi wireframes. I like to work in pencil in the early stages because it’s fast, and I think sketching by hand helps me intuit where page elements should be displayed.</div>

    <h4>In My Wheelhouse</h4>
    <p>I started playing around with the knife and fork from my original checkered-flag logo sketches. I made some vectors in Sketch and started moving them around on the canvas. Once I placed them into a traditional place setting with a plate between, the logo came into sight for me:</p>

    <p>Next it was about creating grayscale wireframes to get my placements and proportions right. Once I got feedback, I iterated over them with color to ensure a second pass on everything.  </p>
    <p>In a perfect world, I would have used these to create an early prototype and tested it with users before finalizing the frames and adding color. In this case, however, I was limited by time and tested with color frames.</p>

    <p>Through the process a couple things became clear: I needed to use my bright red color very sparingly. I adjusted my palette into analogous blues and used my bright red as a primary action color. Its brightness in contrast with the softer blue is a great attention grabber!</p>
