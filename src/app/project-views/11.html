  <p>Salty Running is a collaborative blog for women runners that uses WordPress for its day-to-day content management. I built and styled the original site in 2012 (having no working knowledge of code) by using a theme with a WYSIWYG style editor. At the end of 2015 we decided to make a push for profitability. By this time I had learned enough HTML/CSS to get by, and decided I wanted to learn how to seriously build a new site. </p>
  <p>I enrolled in a dev bootcamp and started learning development. Through that experience I learned how much I didn’t know about design, but the more I tried, the more I loved it. With the help of a branding firm we developed a color palette that felt bold, fast and strong. We updated our logo from a cute little cartoon snail to a cleaner, sleeker version. Then it was time for me to get to work on the details. Here’s what I did with the home page.</p>

    <p>Our number 1 priority was fixing our navigation.</p>
    <p>Previously, SR navigation was two rows of links, all of which had dropdown submenus. After surveying users, I discovered that dropdowns added confusion to the experience instead of helping users find what they’re looking for. I elected to eliminate all dropdown menus in favor of a few simple links that explain what we are. I asked “what do we want to communicate?” Based on feedback from the other partners we decided that we wanted to say this: “Primarily this is a blog. It is written by a team of bloggers. It’s about training for runners. Here’s where you can learn more.”</p>

    <h4>Easy to Find Features</h4>
    <p>SR has lots of regular features, but when we asked users they didn’t know what these were. I added a carousel to make them more accessible. For this, I had to design around development constraints of using the Flickety carousel API, since my stakeholders and I were committed to it. We chose this API after testing two other carousels that did not respond when mobile users tried to ‘flick’ the slides right and left. Integrating Flickety allowed me to have a touch-responsive carousel that was ready out of the box.</p>

    <h4>Find Anything</h4>
    <p>A lot of users come to Salty Running for reference to find tips, race reports, reviews and training information. To help these users pinpoint what they’re looking for, I added a search bar. </p>
    <p>I tested the search bar in the header on mobile screens and found it confused users by disrupting the flow of their reading. So on smaller screens, the search bar disappears from the header and reappears in a menu drawer, as shown:</p>
