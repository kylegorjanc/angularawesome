          <p>I came to design from the world of filmmaking, bringing with me a coffee addiction and a passion for efficient, collaborative, project-based work. Over the last few years I fell in love with design while working on Salty Running, a website I co-founded with my sister, and now I'm looking to join an awesome team I can learn and grow with as I take on my new career!</p>
